DiskImager Setup Instructions
============================

1. Python Environment
---------------------
- Install Python 3.8+ (recommended: use a virtual environment)
- Create a virtual environment:
    python -m venv .venv
- Activate the virtual environment:
    - Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    - Linux/macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
- Install required Python packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. 3rd Party Tools
------------------
- Download qemu-img.exe (for Windows) from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/ or the official QEMU site.
- Place qemu-img.exe in the tools/ directory at the project root (create the folder if it does not exist).
- (Optional) Download 7-Zip (for .7z archiving) and ensure 7z.exe is in your system PATH or tools/.

3. Running the Program
----------------------
- Activate your virtual environment (see above).
- Run the program:
    python main.py
- The GUI will launch. You can image disks, convert formats, and archive images.

4. Notes
--------
- All disk images and archives are ignored by git (see .gitignore).
- The tools/ directory is for 3rd party binaries and is also ignored by git.
- Run as administrator for full disk access on Windows.

For more help, see README.txt in the tools/ directory or contact the project maintainer.
